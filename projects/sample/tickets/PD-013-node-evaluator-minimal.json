  "milestone": "M1: Core + Node runtime",
  "why": "Execute small graphs end-to-end before GPU path exists",
  "what": [
    "Implement evaluator that topologically walks DAG",
    "Provide built-in nodes: solid_color(width,height,color), compose(A,B,mode)",
    "Add simple image tensor (H,W,RGBA8) as ndarray or bytes",
    "Tests for pixel correctness across basic graphs"
  ],
  "acceptance": [
    "Example graph renders expected pixels",
    "Evaluator rejects graphs with missing inputs",
    "Performance baseline recorded for tiny graphs"
